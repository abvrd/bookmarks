A simple bookmark manager with categories over CRUD operations.

Server

## What's inside ?
**Front-end**
* React base architecture with Alt.js (based on Flux).
* Material UI for common components
* Webpack module bundler
* Oh, and ES6 syntax !

**Back-end**
* Node REST API
* Express
* Mocha for tests
* ES6 again
* CORS support for Cross origin resource sharing
* Mongoose for the MongoDB database

## Why doing that ?
I just wanted to learn some React architecture and plug it to a fully functional API environment.
The purpose of the 'exercise' was to train on both node, react and the ES6 syntax.

## Further improvements ?
* Login and user system
* API documentation
* Fetching dynamically images for a given URL (e.g favicon)
* Reordering by drag and drop categories
* Adding more and more tests !
* ...
